# Favicon Host

This repository hosts favicon files for use with my website [modframimagehaus.com](https://modframimagehaus.com).

## Files

- `favicon.ico` - Standard ICO file for browser compatibility (especially Safari)
- `site.webmanifest` - Web app manifest file for Android devices (if you add this)

## Usage

These files are referenced from my Framer website using:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="https://pirellicodes.github.io/favicon-host/favicon.ico">
```

## Why This Repository Exists

Framer doesn't support uploading .ico files directly, so this repository serves as an external host for favicon files to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
